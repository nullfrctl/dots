Dots is an extremely simple bash script which creates a bare git repository in 
your $HOME directory (~/.dotfiles) using the keyword `setup'

Treat the command `dots' as `git', but it only manages the bare repo ~/.dotfiles

  ยง  Usage

Add config files by simply executing:
  dots add <path-to-file>

After that, make a commit, and push to your remote (if you have any connected)

  ยง  Connecting a remote

To do anything with an application like GitHub's `gh' -- `cd' into ~/.dotfiles

Then, just connect your remote with it.

  ยง  Installation

Download the file `dots' from this repository and copy it into your path.
It requires Git and GNU Bash to be installed into the system.
